                Like most website operators, Bookaholic collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Bookaholic's purpose in
                collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Bookaholic's visitors
                use its website. From time to time, Bookaholic may release non-personally-identifying information in
                the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bookaholic also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.bookaholic.com blog
                posts. Bookaholic only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

                Certain visitors to Bookaholic's websites choose to interact with Bookaholic in ways that require
                Bookaholic to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
                Bookaholic gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave
                a comment at http://www.bookaholic.com to provide a username and email address.
